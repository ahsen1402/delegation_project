This github repository contains the code used for the analysis of the paper "Economics of AI and Human Task Sharing for Decision Making in Screening Mammography" by Ahsen et. al. 
We have used R programming language for this. In the paper, we used the statistical software R version 4.4.2. We also used R package ggplot2 version 3.5.1 and pracma version 2.4.4 for creating visualizations. Code file

## Figure 1: Simulated/Synthetic Data
There are two files. The first file, named `functions_simulated.R`, contains the manual functions needed to run the analysis for the simulated data. This needs to be sourced for the analysis. The second file, named `simulated.R`, contains the analysis (including the data needed) which can be used for creating figures as in Figure 1 in the paper.

## Figure 2: Dream Data
This folder contains the code we used for the Dream Challenge Analysis. Unfortunately, to exactly create Figure 2, one needs to access the dream challenge data which we can not share because of the restricted nature of the data.
